This was an interesting project for me. I think this was one of the very first works that I did from scrath. It's not perfect, and that's OK!
I don't really want it to be so that I may see (and others) that I've steadily improved over the past months in my projects and my learning in general.
I got this idea from some friends in Mexico. They have a real problem with stray animals in terms of abuse, abandonment, and overall poor care. Immediately,
my brain switched to "how can I solve a problem" and this idea was basically born. I'd like to make this live one day and free to where users can 
try to find and match stray animals with new prospective owners and/or at least get them some healthcare. I'm not sure yet but I enjoyed the project
nonetheless. If you have some ideas about how I can help address this issue further, please email me, jbailey679@yahoo.com!
